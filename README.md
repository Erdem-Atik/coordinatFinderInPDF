# Coordinate Finder In PDF Doc.
Hello All,
This codes can find a geo coordinate in the PDF document. The coordinates should be 'Lat. Long' format. So it is like 41° 1'0.18"N 28°59'6.55"E!
The PDF.js(powered by Mozilla Foundation) is used in this project. I hope I will improve this project in the near future :)

All the Best
